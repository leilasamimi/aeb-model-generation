### Expected Characteristics of a valid XMI model for the requirement: "Pedestrian within 7 meters, brake and warn in 0.4 seconds"

- **Classes**:
  - AEBSystem
  - Sensor
  - Controller
  - EmergencyAction (two instances)
  - SafetyConstraint
  - Actuator (two instances)
  - DetectionEvent
  - Obstacle

- **Attributes**:
  - **AEBSystem**:
    - systemID: Unique string identifier (e.g., "AEB013")
    - operatingMode: "Emergency" (due to active braking and warning responses)
  - **Sensor**:
    - sensorType: One of "Radar", "Lidar", or "Camera" (e.g., "Camera")
    - range: Double >= 7.0 (to detect pedestrian within 7 meters)
    - accuracy: Float between 0.0 and 100.0 (e.g., 90.0)
  - **Controller**:
    - state: "Acting" (as the system is executing braking and warning actions)
    - decisionLatency: Double > 0.0 (e.g., 0.08)
  - **EmergencyAction (1)**:
    - actionType: "Brake"
    - responseTime: 0.4 (as specified)
    - priority: Integer >= 1 (e.g., 1 for brake)
  - **EmergencyAction (2)**:
    - actionType: "Warn"
    - responseTime: 0.4 (as specified)
    - priority: Integer >= 1 (e.g., 2 for warning)
  - **SafetyConstraint**:
    - constraintType: "Timing"
    - threshold: 0.4 (matches responseTime for both actions)
    - isCritical: true (due to CriticalTiming constraint)
  - **Actuator (1)**:
    - type: "Brake"
    - maxForce: Double > 0.0 (e.g., 1100.0)
    - status: true (actuator is operational)
  - **Actuator (2)**:
    - type: "Horn"
    - maxForce: Double >= 0.0 or omitted (e.g., 0.0, as horn may not require force)
    - status: true (actuator is operational)
  - **DetectionEvent**:
    - timestamp: Long > 0 (e.g., current timestamp like 1698765550)
    - distance: Double <= 7.0 (e.g., 6.5)
    - confidence: Float between 0.0 and 100.0 (e.g., 88.0)
  - **Obstacle**:
    - obstacleType: "Pedestrian"
    - speed: Double <= 30.0 (e.g., 8.0)
    - size: Double > 0.0 (e.g., 1.5)

- **Relationships**:
  - AEBSystem contains:
    - One Sensor
    - One Controller
    - Two Actuators
  - Sensor contains:
    - One DetectionEvent
  - DetectionEvent contains:
    - One Obstacle
  - Controller contains:
    - Two EmergencyActions
    - One SafetyConstraint
  - EmergencyAction (Brake):
    - executedBy: References the Brake Actuator (e.g., "//@actuators.0")
  - EmergencyAction (Warn):
    - executedBy: References the Horn Actuator (e.g., "//@actuators.1")
  - SafetyConstraint:
    - appliesTo: References both EmergencyActions (e.g., "//@controller/@actions.0 //@controller/@actions.1")
  - Actuator (Brake):
    - actions: References the Brake EmergencyAction (e.g., "//@controller/@actions.0")
  - Actuator (Horn):
    - actions: References the Warn EmergencyAction (e.g., "//@controller/@actions.1")

- **Constraint Compliance**:
  - **SpeedRange**:
    - obstacleType is "Pedestrian", speed <= 30.0 (e.g., 8.0, satisfied)
  - **FastResponse**:
    - Both EmergencyActions have responseTime = 0.4 <= 1.0 (satisfied)
  - **CriticalTiming**:
    - SafetyConstraint with isCritical = true has threshold = 0.4 <= 0.5 (satisfied)
