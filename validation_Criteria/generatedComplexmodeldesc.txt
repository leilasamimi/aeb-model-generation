**Expected Characteristics of a Valid XMI Model for the Requirement "If multiple obstacles are detected by radar and lidar within 10 meters under rainy conditions, prioritize the closest obstacle and apply the brake within 0.4 seconds, ensuring SpeedRange compliance"**

The provided characteristics contain some inaccuracies in interpretation and values (e.g., DetectionEvent distances, number of SafetyConstraints, and prioritization of the closest obstacle). Below is a corrected and precise description based on the requirement and AEB metamodel, ensuring full compliance.

- **Classes**:
  - AEBSystem: Represents the overall system.
  - Sensor (2 instances): One for Radar, one for Lidar, to detect multiple obstacles.
  - Controller: Manages decision-making and initiates the brake action.
  - Actuator: Executes the brake action.
  - DetectionEvent (at least 2 instances): One per sensor to represent multiple obstacle detections.
  - Obstacle (at least 2 instances): Represents the detected obstacles, with one being the closest.
  - EmergencyAction: Defines the brake action for the closest obstacle.
  - SafetyConstraint (1 instance): Ensures the timing of the brake action meets safety requirements.
  - EnvironmentCondition: Represents rainy conditions affecting sensors.

- **Attributes**:
  - **AEBSystem**:
    - systemID: Unique string identifier (e.g., "AEB007").
    - operatingMode: "Emergency" due to close proximity and urgent action.
  - **Sensor (Radar)**:
    - sensorType: "Radar".
    - range: Double, >= 10.0 meters to detect within 10 meters.
    - accuracy: Float, reasonable but reduced due to rain (e.g., 85.0–92.0).
  - **Sensor (Lidar)**:
    - sensorType: "Lidar".
    - range: Double, >= 10.0 meters.
    - accuracy: Float, reduced due to rain (e.g., 80.0–90.0).
  - **Controller**:
    - state: "Acting" to reflect immediate brake action.
    - decisionLatency: Double, small value for quick response (e.g., 0.05–0.1 seconds).
  - **EmergencyAction**:
    - actionType: "Brake" as specified.
    - responseTime: Double, exactly 0.4 seconds per requirement.
    - priority: Integer, high priority (e.g., 1) to prioritize the closest obstacle.
  - **SafetyConstraint**:
    - constraintType: "Timing" to enforce brake response time.
    - threshold: Double, 0.4 seconds to match responseTime.
    - isCritical: Boolean, true since threshold <= 0.5 seconds.
  - **Actuator**:
    - type: "Brake" to match EmergencyAction.
    - maxForce: Double, sufficient for braking (e.g., 1000.0–1500.0).
    - status: Boolean, true to indicate operational.
  - **DetectionEvent (Radar)**:
    - timestamp: Long, valid timestamp (e.g., current time in milliseconds).
    - distance: Double, <= 10.0 meters (e.g., 8.0 meters for a secondary obstacle).
    - confidence: Float, reasonable for radar in rain (e.g., 80.0–90.0).
  - **DetectionEvent (Lidar)**:
    - timestamp: Long, valid timestamp, close to Radar’s timestamp.
    - distance: Double, <= 10.0 meters and the closest (e.g., 4.0 meters).
    - confidence: Float, reasonable for lidar in rain (e.g., 80.0–90.0).
  - **Obstacle (Radar)**:
    - obstacleType: One of {Vehicle, Pedestrian, Static}.
    - speed: Double, complies with SpeedRange (e.g., Vehicle <= 120.0, Pedestrian <= 30.0, Static = 0.0).
    - size: Double, positive value (e.g., 1.0–5.0).
  - **Obstacle (Lidar)**:
    - obstacleType: One of {Vehicle, Pedestrian, Static}.
    - speed: Double, complies with SpeedRange.
    - size: Double, positive value (e.g., 1.0–5.0).
  - **EnvironmentCondition**:
    - conditionType: "Rain" as specified.
    - severity: Float, positive value reflecting rain intensity (e.g., 50.0–80.0).

- **Relationships**:
  - **AEBSystem** contains Sensors, Controller, Actuator, and EnvironmentCondition.
  - **Sensor (Radar)** contains at least one DetectionEvent.
  - **Sensor (Lidar)** contains at least one DetectionEvent for the closest obstacle.
  - **DetectionEvent** contains Obstacle and is triggeredBy its Sensor (implicit in containment).
  - **Controller** contains EmergencyAction and SafetyConstraint.
  - **EmergencyAction** executedBy Actuator (references the brake Actuator).
  - **Actuator** actions EmergencyAction (bidirectional reference to EmergencyAction).
  - **SafetyConstraint** appliesTo EmergencyAction (references the brake action).
  - **EnvironmentCondition** affects both Sensors (Radar and Lidar).

- **Constraint Compliance**:
  - **SpeedRange**:
    - Obstacle (Vehicle): speed <= 120.0 (e.g., 50.0 complies).
    - Obstacle (Pedestrian): speed <= 30.0 (e.g., 5.0 complies).
    - Obstacle (Static): speed = 0.0 (complies implicitly).
  - **FastResponse**:
    - EmergencyAction responseTime = 0.4 seconds <= 1.0 seconds.
  - **CriticalTiming**:
    - SafetyConstraint with constraintType = "Timing" and isCritical = true has threshold = 0.4 seconds <= 0.5 seconds.
  - The model prioritizes the closest obstacle (e.g., Lidar’s DetectionEvent at 4.0 meters) by triggering the EmergencyAction based on it.
  - All references (e.g., executedBy, appliesTo, affects) resolve to valid instances within the model.
