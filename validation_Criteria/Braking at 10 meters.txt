### Expected Characteristics of a Valid XMI Model for the Requirement: "Obstacle within 10 meters, brake in 0.5 seconds"

- **Classes**:
  - AEBSystem
  - Sensor
  - Controller
  - EmergencyAction
  - SafetyConstraint
  - Actuator
  - DetectionEvent
  - Obstacle

- **Attributes**:
  - **AEBSystem**:
    - systemID: Unique string identifier (e.g., "AEB011")
    - operatingMode: "Emergency" (due to active braking response)
  - **Sensor**:
    - sensorType: One of "Radar", "Lidar", or "Camera" (e.g., "Radar")
    - range: Double >= 10.0 (to detect obstacle within 10 meters)
    - accuracy: Float between 0.0 and 100.0 (e.g., 95.0)
  - **Controller**:
    - state: "Acting" (as the system is executing a braking action)
    - decisionLatency: Double > 0.0 (e.g., 0.1)
  - **EmergencyAction**:
    - actionType: "Brake"
    - responseTime: 0.5 (as specified)
    - priority: Integer >= 1 (e.g., 1 for high priority)
  - **SafetyConstraint**:
    - constraintType: "Timing"
    - threshold: 0.5 (matches responseTime)
    - isCritical: true (due to CriticalTiming constraint)
  - **Actuator**:
    - type: "Brake"
    - maxForce: Double > 0.0 (e.g., 1000.0)
    - status: true (actuator is operational)
  - **DetectionEvent**:
    - timestamp: Long > 0 (e.g., current timestamp like 1698765530)
    - distance: Double <= 10.0 (e.g., 8.0)
    - confidence: Float between 0.0 and 100.0 (e.g., 90.0)
  - **Obstacle**:
    - obstacleType: One of "Vehicle", "Pedestrian", or "Static" (e.g., "Vehicle")
    - speed: Double (e.g., 20.0 for Vehicle, 0.0 for Static)
    - size: Double > 0.0 (e.g., 4.0)

- **Relationships**:
  - AEBSystem contains:
    - One Sensor
    - One Controller
    - One Actuator
  - Sensor contains:
    - One DetectionEvent
  - DetectionEvent contains:
    - One Obstacle
  - Controller contains:
    - One EmergencyAction
    - One SafetyConstraint
  - EmergencyAction:
    - executedBy: References the Actuator (e.g., "//@actuators.0")
  - SafetyConstraint:
    - appliesTo: References the EmergencyAction (e.g., "//@controller/@actions.0")
  - Actuator:
    - actions: References the EmergencyAction (e.g., "//@controller/@actions.0")

- **Constraint Compliance**:
  - **SpeedRange**:
    - If obstacleType is "Pedestrian", speed <= 30.0
    - If obstacleType is "Vehicle", speed <= 120.0
    - If obstacleType is "Static", speed typically 0.0 (implicitly satisfied)
  - **FastResponse**:
    - EmergencyAction responseTime = 0.5 <= 1.0 (satisfied)
  - **CriticalTiming**:
    - SafetyConstraint with isCritical = true has threshold = 0.5 <= 0.5 (satisfied)
