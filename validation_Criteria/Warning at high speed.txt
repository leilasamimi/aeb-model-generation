### Expected Characteristics of a Valid XMI Model for the Requirement: "If a vehicle's speed exceeds 50 km/h, warn within 1.0 second"

- **Classes**:
  - AEBSystem
  - Sensor
  - Controller
  - EmergencyAction
  - SafetyConstraint
  - Actuator
  - DetectionEvent
  - Obstacle

- **Attributes**:
  - **AEBSystem**:
    - systemID: Unique string identifier (e.g., "AEB012")
    - operatingMode: "Emergency" (due to active warning response)
  - **Sensor**:
    - sensorType: One of "Radar", "Lidar", or "Camera" (e.g., "Radar")
    - range: Double > 0.0, sufficient to detect vehicle (e.g., 50.0)
    - accuracy: Float between 0.0 and 100.0 (e.g., 93.0)
  - **Controller**:
    - state: "Acting" (as the system is executing a warning action)
    - decisionLatency: Double > 0.0 (e.g., 0.15)
  - **EmergencyAction**:
    - actionType: "Warn"
    - responseTime: 1.0 (as specified)
    - priority: Integer >= 1 (e.g., 2 for warning)
  - **SafetyConstraint**:
    - constraintType: "Timing"
    - threshold: 1.0 (matches responseTime)
    - isCritical: false (since threshold = 1.0 > 0.5)
  - **Actuator**:
    - type: "Horn"
    - maxForce: Double >= 0.0 or omitted (e.g., 0.0, as horn may not require force)
    - status: true (actuator is operational)
  - **DetectionEvent**:
    - timestamp: Long > 0 (e.g., current timestamp like 1698765540)
    - distance: Double > 0.0 (e.g., 20.0, as distance not specified in requirement)
    - confidence: Float between 0.0 and 100.0 (e.g., 87.0)
  - **Obstacle**:
    - obstacleType: "Vehicle"
    - speed: Double > 50.0 (e.g., 55.0 to satisfy requirement)
    - size: Double > 0.0 (e.g., 4.5)

- **Relationships**:
  - AEBSystem contains:
    - One Sensor
    - One Controller
    - One Actuator
  - Sensor contains:
    - One DetectionEvent
  - DetectionEvent contains:
    - One Obstacle
  - Controller contains:
    - One EmergencyAction
    - One SafetyConstraint
  - EmergencyAction:
    - executedBy: References the Actuator (e.g., "//@actuators.0")
  - SafetyConstraint:
    - appliesTo: References the EmergencyAction (e.g., "//@controller/@actions.0")
  - Actuator:
    - actions: References the EmergencyAction (e.g., "//@controller/@actions.0")

- **Constraint Compliance**:
  - **SpeedRange**:
    - obstacleType is "Vehicle", speed > 50.0 and <= 120.0 (e.g., 55.0, satisfied)
  - **FastResponse**:
    - EmergencyAction responseTime = 1.0 <= 1.0 (satisfied)
  - **CriticalTiming**:
    - SafetyConstraint isCritical = false, so CriticalTiming (threshold <= 0.5) does not apply (satisfied)
