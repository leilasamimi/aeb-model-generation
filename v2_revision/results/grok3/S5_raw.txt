Based on the provided requirement "If an obstacle is detected within 15 meters, steer in 1.0 second," and adhering to the AEB metamodel structure and constraints, the following XMI model is generated:

### Explanation of the Model:
1. **AEBSystem**: Assigned a unique `systemID="AEB006"`. The `operatingMode` is not explicitly set to "Emergency" since the requirement does not indicate an extreme urgency or environmental condition necessitating it (default assumed as "Normal").
2. **Sensor**: Configured with `sensorType="Radar"`, a `range="20.0"` (greater than the detection distance of 15 meters), and `accuracy="94.0"`. It includes a `DetectionEvent` with:
   - `timestamp="1698765480"` (a sample value),
   - `distance="12.0"` (less than 15 meters as per the requirement),
   - `confidence="89.0"` (a reasonable value for detection reliability).
3. **Obstacle**: Defined as `obstacleType="Vehicle"`, with `speed="40.0"` (within the constraint `Vehicle speed <= 120.0`) and `size="4.5"` (indicative of a typical vehicle).
4. **Controller**: Set to `state="Acting"` (since an action is being taken) with a `decisionLatency="0.2"` (a realistic value for processing). It includes:
   - An `EmergencyAction` with `actionType="Steer"`, `responseTime="1.0"` (as per requirement and within the `FastResponse` constraint of <= 1.0), and `priority="2"` (moderate priority for steering).
   - A `SafetyConstraint` with `constraintType="Distance"`, `threshold="15.0"` (matching the detection range in the requirement), and `isCritical="false"` (since steering is not as urgent as braking and no timing criticality is implied).
5. **Actuator**: Configured with `type="Steering"`, `maxForce="600.0"` (a plausible value for steering force), and `status="true"` (indicating it is operational). It is linked to the steering action via the `actions` reference.
6. **Constraints Compliance**:
   - `SpeedRange`: Obstacle speed (40.0) is within the limit for a vehicle (<= 120.0).
   - `FastResponse`: EmergencyAction `responseTime="1.0"` satisfies the constraint (<= 1.0).
   - `CriticalTiming`: Not applicable since `isCritical="false"` and the constraint type is "Distance", not "Timing".

This model aligns with the provided requirement and adheres to the AEB metamodel structure and constraints, ensuring consistency with the examples provided.
