Based on the given requirement "If an obstacle is detected within 6 meters, warn in 0.3 seconds," and ensuring compliance with the AEB metamodel structure and constraints, the following XMI model is generated. The model adheres to the constraints such as `FastResponse` (responseTime <= 1.0) and includes necessary elements like `Sensor`, `DetectionEvent`, `Controller`, `EmergencyAction`, `Actuator`, and `SafetyConstraint`.

### Explanation of the Model:
1. **AEBSystem**: Assigned a unique `systemID="AEB006"` and set `operatingMode="Emergency"` to reflect the urgency of the situation as an obstacle is detected within a close range (6 meters).
2. **Sensor**: Configured with `sensorType="Radar"`, a reasonable `range="8.0"` meters (covering the detection requirement of 6 meters), and `accuracy="92.0"` to indicate reliable detection.
3. **DetectionEvent**: Set `distance="5.5"` meters (less than 6 meters as per requirement), with a `timestamp="1698765480"` and `confidence="85.0"`. It includes an `Obstacle` of type `Static` with `speed="0.0"` and `size="3.0"`.
4. **Controller**: Set to `state="Acting"` to indicate active response to the detection, with a low `decisionLatency="0.1"` seconds for quick processing.
5. **EmergencyAction**: Defined as `actionType="Warn"` with `responseTime="0.3"` seconds (meeting the requirement and adhering to the `FastResponse` constraint of <= 1.0 seconds), and `priority="2"` to reflect a warning action.
6. **SafetyConstraint**: Set as `constraintType="Timing"`, with `threshold="0.3"` and `isCritical="true"` (complying with `CriticalTiming` constraint of threshold <= 0.5 for critical timing constraints), applied to the warning action.
7. **Actuator**: Configured as `type="Horn"` for the warning action, with `maxForce="0.0"` (since force is irrelevant for a horn), and `status="true"` to indicate it is operational.

This model ensures compliance with the AEB metamodel structure and constraints while addressing the specific requirement of warning within 0.3 seconds for an obstacle detected within 6 meters.
