Based on the new requirement "If the brake actuator is unavailable, prefer steering or warning actions," I will generate an XMI model compliant with the AEB metamodel. The model will reflect a scenario where the brake actuator is unavailable (status="false"), and alternative actions (steering and warning) are prioritized. The model will adhere to the metamodel structure and constraints, including SpeedRange, FastResponse, and CriticalTiming.

### Explanation of the Model:
1. **AEBSystem**: Identified as "AEB006" with `operatingMode="Emergency"` to reflect the critical nature of the situation where the brake actuator is unavailable.
2. **Sensors**: A Radar sensor with a range of 15.0 meters and accuracy of 92.0% detects an obstacle (vehicle) at 12.0 meters.
3. **DetectionEvent and Obstacle**: The obstacle is a vehicle with a speed of 40.0 (within the SpeedRange constraint of <=120.0) and size of 4.5.
4. **Controller**: The state is "Acting" with a decision latency of 0.2 seconds. Two emergency actions are defined:
   - `Steer` with `responseTime="0.8"` and `priority="1"`, executed by the Steering actuator.
   - `Warn` with `responseTime="0.5"` and `priority="2"`, executed by the Horn actuator.
   Both actions comply with the FastResponse constraint (`responseTime <= 1.0`).
5. **SafetyConstraint**: A critical timing constraint with `threshold="0.5"` (complying with CriticalTiming constraint of <=0.5 for critical timing) applies to both actions.
6. **Actuators**: Three actuators are modeled:
   - Brake actuator with `status="false"` to reflect unavailability.
   - Steering actuator with `status="true"`, linked to the Steer action.
   - Horn actuator with `status="true"`, linked to the Warn action.
7. **Requirement Compliance**: Since the brake actuator is unavailable, the model prioritizes steering (higher priority) and warning actions as alternatives, fulfilling the requirement.

This model adheres to the AEB metamodel structure, constraints, and the specific requirement provided.
