Based on the provided requirement "If something is too close, react quickly," I will interpret "too close" as an obstacle within 5 meters and "react quickly" as initiating a braking action within 0.3 seconds. This interpretation aligns with the emergency scenarios depicted in the examples, where quick response times and close distances are critical. The model will be constructed to comply with the AEB metamodel structure and constraints (e.g., FastResponse, CriticalTiming, SpeedRange).

Below is the generated XMI model:

### Explanation of the Model:
1. **AEBSystem**: Assigned a unique `systemID="AEB006"` and set `operatingMode="Emergency"` to reflect the critical nature of the requirement.
2. **Sensor**: Configured as `Radar` with a `range="8.0"` meters and `accuracy="92.0"`, suitable for detecting close obstacles. The `DetectionEvent` indicates an obstacle at `distance="4.0"` meters (interpreted as "too close") with a high `confidence="85.0"`.
3. **Obstacle**: Defined as a `Vehicle` with `speed="25.0"` (within the constraint SpeedRange <= 120.0) and `size="3.5"` to represent a typical car.
4. **Controller**: Set to `state="Acting"` with a low `decisionLatency="0.05"` to ensure quick processing. An `EmergencyAction` of type `Brake` is defined with `responseTime="0.3"` (satisfying FastResponse <= 1.0, interpreted as "react quickly") and `priority="1"`.
5. **SafetyConstraint**: A `Timing` constraint with `threshold="0.3"` and `isCritical="true"` is applied (satisfying CriticalTiming <= 0.5) to the braking action.
6. **Actuator**: Configured as `Brake` with `maxForce="1300.0"` and `status="true"`, linked to the braking action.

This model adheres to the AEB metamodel structure, respects all specified constraints, and captures the essence of the requirement by modeling a quick reaction to a nearby obstacle.
