Based on the provided requirement "If time-to-collision is less than 0.5 seconds, immediately apply braking," I will generate an XMI model that adheres to the AEB metamodel structure and constraints. The model will include necessary elements such as a sensor detecting an obstacle, a controller with an emergency action for braking, an actuator for executing the braking action, and a critical timing constraint to reflect the urgency of the situation.

Below is the generated XMI model:

### Explanation of the Model:
1. **AEBSystem**: 
   - `systemID="AEB006"` uniquely identifies the system.
   - `operatingMode="Emergency"` reflects the critical nature of the situation due to the short time-to-collision.

2. **Sensor**:
   - `sensorType="Radar"` is chosen for its effectiveness in detecting obstacles at moderate distances.
   - `range="15.0"` and `accuracy="93.0"` are set to realistic values for detecting an obstacle.
   - A `DetectionEvent` is included with `distance="7.5"` and a `timestamp` to simulate a detected obstacle. The `confidence="89.0"` indicates a reliable detection.
   - The `Obstacle` is of type `Vehicle` with `speed="40.0"` (compliant with SpeedRange constraint <= 120.0) and `size="4.5"`.

3. **Controller**:
   - `state="Acting"` indicates the system is actively responding to the detected threat.
   - `decisionLatency="0.05"` is set to a very low value to reflect immediate decision-making.
   - An `EmergencyAction` with `actionType="Brake"` is defined with `responseTime="0.2"` (compliant with FastResponse constraint <= 1.0) and `priority="1"` to indicate high urgency.
   - A `SafetyConstraint` of `constraintType="Timing"` with `threshold="0.5"` and `isCritical="true"` is included to enforce the time-to-collision requirement (compliant with CriticalTiming constraint).

4. **Actuator**:
   - `type="Brake"` matches the required action.
   - `maxForce="1300.0"` and `status="true"` indicate the actuator is operational and capable of applying significant braking force.
   - The `actions` reference links to the braking action defined in the controller.

5. **Constraints Compliance**:
   - `SpeedRange`: Obstacle speed (40.0) is within the limit for Vehicle (<= 120.0).
   - `FastResponse`: EmergencyAction responseTime (0.2) is within the limit (<= 1.0).
   - `CriticalTiming`: Timing constraint with `isCritical="true"` has `threshold="0.5"`, satisfying the constraint (<= 0.5).

This model captures the requirement of immediate braking when time-to-collision is less than 0.5 seconds, ensuring compliance with the AEB metamodel structure and constraints.
