Let's generate an XMI model for the given requirement, ensuring compliance with the AEB metamodel and its constraints.

**Requirement Analysis:**
- Pedestrian detected at exactly 5 meters.
- Speed of pedestrian is 30 km/h.
- Need to decide based on safety constraints (assuming immediate braking due to close proximity and high speed for a pedestrian).
- According to constraints: Pedestrian speed <= 30.0 (satisfied), EmergencyAction responseTime <= 1.0 (will be set accordingly), and critical timing threshold <= 0.5 (will be applied).

Since the pedestrian is at a critical distance of 5 meters and moving at the maximum allowed speed for a pedestrian, the system should operate in Emergency mode, trigger a braking action with a fast response time, and apply critical safety constraints.

**XMI Model:**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<aEBsystem:AEBSystem
    xmi:version="2.0"
    xmlns:xmi="http://www.omg.org/XMI"

  </sensors>

        priority="1"
        executedBy="//@actuators.0"/>
    <constraints
        constraintType="Timing"
        threshold="0.3"

        appliesTo="//@controller/@actions.0"/>
  </controller>
  <actuators

      maxForce="1300.0"
      status="true"
      actions="//@controller/@actions.0"/>
</aEBsystem:AEBSystem>
```

**Explanation of Model Choices:**
1. **AEBSystem**: Set `systemID="AEB006"` for uniqueness and `operatingMode="Emergency"` due to the critical proximity (5 meters) and high pedestrian speed (30 km/h).
2. **Sensor**: Used `sensorType="Camera"` as it is suitable for pedestrian detection at close range. Set `range="8.0"` to cover the detection distance and `accuracy="92.0"` for high reliability.
3. **DetectionEvent**: Set `distance="5.0"` as per requirement, `timestamp="1698765480"` (arbitrary but unique), and high `confidence="95.0"` due to close proximity.
4. **Obstacle**: Set `obstacleType="Pedestrian"`, `speed="30.0"` (as given, satisfies SpeedRange constraint <= 30.0), and `size="1.7"` (reasonable for a pedestrian).
5. **Controller**: Set `state="Acting"` to reflect active response and `decisionLatency="0.05"` for quick decision-making in emergency.
6. **EmergencyAction**: Set `actionType="Brake"` as the most appropriate response for a close pedestrian, `responseTime="0.3"` (satisfies FastResponse constraint <= 1.0), and `priority="1"` for highest urgency.
7. **SafetyConstraint**: Set `constraintType="Timing"`, `threshold="0.3"` (satisfies CriticalTiming constraint <= 0.5), and `isCritical="true"` due to the emergency nature.
8. **Actuator**: Set `type="Brake"`, `maxForce="1300.0"` for strong braking force, and `status="true"` to indicate availability.
9. **References**: Properly linked `executedBy` and `appliesTo` using XMI paths to maintain model integrity.

This model adheres to the AEB metamodel structure, satisfies all specified constraints (SpeedRange, FastResponse, CriticalTiming), and addresses the requirement effectively by prioritizing a fast braking response to mitigate the risk posed by the pedestrian at 5 meters with 30 km/h speed.
