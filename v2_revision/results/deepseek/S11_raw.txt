Looking at the requirement, I need to model a scenario where the brake actuator is unavailable, so the system should prefer steering or warning actions instead. I'll create an AEB system with a detection event, but configure it to use steering as the primary emergency action since braking is unavailable.

**Explanation of the model:**

1. **AEBSystem**: System ID "AEB006" with operating mode set to "Emergency" since an obstacle is detected.

2. **Sensor**: Radar sensor with 15m range and 92% accuracy, containing a detection event.

3. **DetectionEvent**: Obstacle detected at 12m distance with 85% confidence. The obstacle is a vehicle traveling at 45 km/h (within the Vehicle speed constraint of ≤120.0).

4. **Controller**: In "Acting" state with decision latency of 0.15 seconds. It contains:
   - **EmergencyAction**: Steering action with response time of 0.8 seconds (≤1.0, satisfying FastResponse constraint), priority 1, executed by the steering actuator.
   - **SafetyConstraint**: Distance constraint with threshold of 12.0 meters applied to the steering action.

5. **Actuators**:
   - Steering actuator: Available (status=true) with max force of 600.0, configured to execute the steering action.
   - Brake actuator: Unavailable (status=false) as specified in the requirement.

**Key compliance points:**
- The model follows the metamodel structure with all required elements
- Vehicle speed (45.0) ≤ 120.0 (SpeedRange constraint)
- Response time (0.8) ≤ 1.0 (FastResponse constraint)
- Brake actuator is marked as unavailable (status=false)
- System uses steering action instead of braking as required
- All references between elements are properly established
