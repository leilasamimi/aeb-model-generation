**Explanation:**

1. **AEBSystem**: Created with systemID "AEB006" (operatingMode defaults to Normal since not specified).

2. **Sensor**: 
   - Range set to 20.0 meters (exceeds the 15m detection requirement)
   - Accuracy set to 95.0%
   - Contains one DetectionEvent with distance 14.0m (< 15m requirement)

3. **DetectionEvent**:
   - Timestamp: arbitrary value
   - Distance: 14.0 meters (within the 15m requirement)
   - Confidence: 91.0%
   - Contains an Obstacle with speed 40.0 (valid for Vehicle type) and size 4.5

4. **Controller**:
   - State: "Acting" (since steering action is required)
   - DecisionLatency: 0.2 seconds
   - Contains one EmergencyAction of type "Steer" with responseTime 1.0 second
   - Contains one SafetyConstraint of type "Distance" with threshold 15.0 meters

5. **EmergencyAction**:
   - actionType: "Steer" (as specified in requirement)
   - responseTime: 1.0 second (as specified, satisfies FastResponse constraint ≤1.0)
   - priority: 2 (steering typically lower priority than braking)
   - executedBy: references the steering actuator

6. **SafetyConstraint**:
   - constraintType: "Distance" (since requirement specifies distance threshold)
   - threshold: 15.0 meters (as specified in requirement)
   - isCritical: not specified (defaults to false, so CriticalTiming constraint doesn't apply)

7. **Actuator**:
   - type: "Steering" (matches the steer action)
   - maxForce: 600.0 (reasonable value for steering)
   - status: true (active)
   - actions: references the steer emergency action

The model satisfies all metamodel constraints:
- SpeedRange: Obstacle speed 40.0 ≤ 120.0 (assuming Vehicle type)
- FastResponse: responseTime 1.0 ≤ 1.0
- CriticalTiming: Not applicable since isCritical is not true
