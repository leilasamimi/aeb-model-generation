Based on the requirement "The object appears dangerously near and requires immediate action," I'll create an XMI model with a very close obstacle requiring a fast emergency response.

**Key design decisions based on the requirement:**

1. **Very close distance**: "dangerously near" is interpreted as 2.5 meters (well within typical emergency braking range)
2. **Immediate action**: Fast response time of 0.2 seconds (well under the FastResponse constraint of ≤1.0)
3. **Critical timing constraint**: Threshold of 0.2 seconds (satisfies CriticalTiming constraint: isCritical=true implies threshold ≤0.5)
4. **Additional distance constraint**: Added a critical distance constraint with 3.0 meter threshold
5. **Vehicle obstacle**: Assumed a vehicle obstacle with speed 40.0 (within Vehicle speed constraint ≤120.0)
6. **Emergency mode**: System set to Emergency operating mode
7. **Fast decision latency**: Very low controller decision latency of 0.02 seconds
8. **High priority**: Priority 1 for the emergency brake action
9. **Radar sensor**: Used Radar for close-range detection with high accuracy
10. **High brake force**: Maximum force of 1500.0 for immediate stopping power

The model satisfies all metamodel constraints:
- SpeedRange: Vehicle speed 40.0 ≤ 120.0 ✓
- FastResponse: EmergencyAction responseTime 0.2 ≤ 1.0 ✓
- CriticalTiming: Timing constraint with isCritical=true has threshold 0.2 ≤ 0.5 ✓
