**Explanation of compliance with the metamodel and constraints:**

1. **AEBSystem**: Contains systemID, operatingMode (set to Emergency since warning action is triggered), and contains all required components.

2. **Sensor**: Contains a DetectionEvent with distance (5.5m) within the 6-meter requirement. The sensor range (10.0) exceeds detection distance.

3. **DetectionEvent**: Contains timestamp, distance, confidence, and references an Obstacle.

4. **Obstacle**: Has speed (15.0) and size (3.0) attributes. Speed is within the Vehicle constraint (≤120.0).

5. **Controller**: State is "Acting" since it's executing an emergency action. Contains one EmergencyAction and one SafetyConstraint.

6. **EmergencyAction**: 
   - actionType: "Warn" (as specified in requirement)
   - responseTime: 0.3 seconds (meets FastResponse constraint: ≤1.0)
   - priority: 1 (highest priority for warning)
   - executedBy: References the actuator

7. **SafetyConstraint**:
   - constraintType: "Timing" (appropriate for response time requirement)
   - threshold: 0.3 seconds (matches responseTime)
   - isCritical: true (implies threshold ≤0.5, meeting CriticalTiming constraint)

8. **Actuator**:
   - type: "Horn" (appropriate for warning action)
   - status: true (active)
   - actions: References the emergency action

All metamodel relationships are maintained:
- Sensor contains DetectionEvent
- DetectionEvent contains Obstacle
- Controller contains EmergencyAction and SafetyConstraint
- SafetyConstraint appliesTo EmergencyAction
- EmergencyAction executedBy Actuator
- Actuator actions references EmergencyAction
