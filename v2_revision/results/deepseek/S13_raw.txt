Based on the requirement, we need to model a scenario where a time-to-collision constraint triggers an emergency braking action. The requirement implies a critical timing constraint with a threshold of 0.5 seconds.

Here's the XMI model:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<aEBsystem:AEBSystem
    xmi:version="2.0"
    xmlns:xmi="http://www.omg.org/XMI"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:aEBsystem="http://www.example.org/aEBsystem"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.example.org/aEBsystem aEBsystem.ecore"
    systemID="AEB006"
    operatingMode="Emergency">
    
  <!-- Sensor detecting an obstacle with time-to-collision calculation -->
  <sensors 
      sensorType="Radar"
      range="50.0"
      accuracy="92.0">
    <detectionEvents
        timestamp="1698765480"
        distance="15.0"
        confidence="95.0">
      <obstacle
          obstacleType="Vehicle"
          speed="30.0"
          size="4.5"/>
    </detectionEvents>
  </sensors>
  
  <!-- Controller assessing and acting on the critical timing constraint -->
  <controller
      state="Acting"
      decisionLatency="0.05">
      
    <!-- Emergency braking action with immediate response -->
    <actions
        actionType="Brake"
        responseTime="0.1"
        priority="1"
        executedBy="//@actuators.0"/>
    
    <!-- Critical timing constraint for time-to-collision -->
    <constraints
        constraintType="Timing"
        threshold="0.5"
        isCritical="true"
        appliesTo="//@controller/@actions.0"/>
  </controller>
  
  <!-- Brake actuator to execute the emergency action -->
  <actuators
      type="Brake"
      maxForce="1500.0"
      status="true"
      actions="//@controller/@actions.0"/>
      
</aEBsystem:AEBSystem>
```

**Key elements in this model:**

1. **System Configuration**: 
   - `systemID="AEB006"` with `operatingMode="Emergency"` since this is a critical scenario

2. **Sensor and Detection**:
   - Radar sensor with 50m range detecting a vehicle
   - Detection event shows a vehicle at 15m distance
   - Vehicle speed is 30.0 (within Vehicle speed constraint ≤ 120.0)

3. **Controller and Emergency Action**:
   - Controller in "Acting" state with low decision latency (0.05s)
   - Emergency braking action with very fast response time (0.1s ≤ 1.0, satisfying FastResponse constraint)
   - Priority 1 (highest) for immediate braking

4. **Safety Constraint**:
   - Timing constraint with threshold 0.5 seconds
   - `isCritical="true"` which implies `threshold ≤ 0.5` (satisfying CriticalTiming constraint)

5. **Actuator**:
   - Brake actuator with high maxForce (1500.0) ready to execute the braking action

The model satisfies all metamodel constraints:
- Vehicle speed (30.0) ≤ 120.0 (SpeedRange constraint)
- Response time (0.1s) ≤ 1.0s (FastResponse constraint)
- Critical timing constraint threshold (0.5s) ≤ 0.5s (CriticalTiming constraint)
