Based on the requirement, we need to model a scenario where:
1. A radar sensor detects an obstacle at 9 meters
2. A camera sensor does NOT detect it (implied by "camera does not")
3. The system should react safely when any sensor detects danger
4. The reaction should be appropriate for "imminent danger"

Here's the XMI model:

```

**Key points about this model:**

1. **Two sensors**: Radar (with detection) and Camera (without detection events)
2. **Radar detection**: Shows an obstacle at 9 meters (within the "imminent danger" range)
3. **Obstacle type**: Vehicle with speed 40.0 km/h (within Vehicle speed constraint ≤120.0)
4. **Controller state**: "Acting" since the system needs to react
5. **Emergency action**: Brake with response time 0.8 seconds (≤1.0, satisfying FastResponse constraint)
6. **Safety constraints**: 
   - Distance constraint (threshold 10.0 meters) - obstacle is within this range
   - Timing constraint (threshold 1.0 seconds) - not critical (isCritical="false"), so doesn't need to satisfy CriticalTiming constraint
7. **Operating mode**: Emergency (since there's imminent danger)
8. **No environment conditions specified**: The requirement doesn't mention any environmental factors

The model represents a safe reaction to radar detection while acknowledging the camera's lack of detection, which could represent sensor disagreement or different detection capabilities.
