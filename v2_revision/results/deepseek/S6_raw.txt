Based on the requirement "If something is too close, react quickly," I will create a model that interprets "too close" as a short detection distance and "react quickly" as a fast emergency action (brake). I'll assume a generic obstacle and default values where necessary.

**Explanation of design choices:**

1. **Interpretation of "too close":** I used a detection distance of 2.0 meters (well within the sensor's 5.0 meter range) to represent a dangerously close obstacle.

2. **Interpretation of "react quickly":** I used a very fast emergency brake response time of 0.2 seconds, which satisfies the "FastResponse" constraint (≤ 1.0 seconds).

3. **Critical Timing Constraint:** Since the response is very fast (0.2 seconds), I added a critical timing constraint with threshold=0.2, which satisfies the "CriticalTiming" constraint (≤ 0.5 seconds when isCritical=true).

4. **Operating Mode:** Set to "Emergency" since the system is actively reacting to a close obstacle.

5. **Default Values:** Used generic values for obstacle speed/size, sensor accuracy, and actuator force where the requirement didn't specify details.

6. **Constraints Compliance:**
   - FastResponse: 0.2 ≤ 1.0 ✓
   - CriticalTiming: 0.2 ≤ 0.5 ✓
   - SpeedRange: Vehicle speed 15.0 ≤ 120.0 ✓

The model represents an AEB system detecting an obstacle at 2 meters and initiating a brake action within 0.2 seconds, which aligns with the requirement's intent of quick reaction to proximity.
